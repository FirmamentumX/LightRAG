Øverland became a communist sympathizer from the early 1920s and became a member of Mot Dag . He also served as chairman of the Norwegian Students Society 1923–28 . He changed his stand in 1937 , partly as an expression of dissent against the ongoing Moscow Trials . He was an avid opponent of Nazism and in 1936 he wrote the poem Du må ikke sove which was printed in the journal Samtiden . It ends with . ( I thought: : Something is imminent . Our era is over – Europe’s on fire! ) .
